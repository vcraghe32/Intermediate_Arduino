## LED blink revisited
What it does: Makes an LED fade in and out, using a function.

What I learned: How to create an increasing and decreasing function and apply it to an LED. I also learned how to use analogWrite and further extended my use of variables. 

Struggles: It was hard for me to get comfortable not using the digitalWrite command, but overall this assignment was straightforward.
