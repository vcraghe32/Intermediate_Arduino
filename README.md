## LED blink revisited
 
What it does: Makes an LED fade in and out, using a function.

What I learned: How to create an increasing and decreasing function and apply it to an LED. I also learned how to use analogWrite and further extended my use of variables. 

Struggles: It was hard for me to get comfortable not using the digitalWrite command, but overall this assignment was straightforward.

## Hello LCD
What it does: Prints out "Hello world" on the first line of the LCD and prints out the time in seconds on the second line of the LCD.

What I learned: How to set up an lcd screen and print out letters and integers on it.

Struggles: It was hard to 
## New Ping

What it does: uses New Ping to replace the distance function that we created in the first ultrasonic sensor project, and when you press a button the serial monitor shows the distance
